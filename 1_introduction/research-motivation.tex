\section{Research motivations and objectives}\label{sec:intro:motivation}

%As argue later in \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:dis:gen-dis},
The main objectives of this thesis are fivefold: (i) collect and make publicly available the first \ac{mpmri} dataset; (ii) design, develop, and investigate a \ac{cad} system taking advantage of all available \ac{mri} modalities; (iii) focus on pre-processing methods to improve the classification performance of \ac{cad} systems; (iv) investigate the problem of imbalanced dataset in the \ac{cad} performance; (v) release source code to allow future benchmarking.
