\section{Thesis outline} \label{sec:intro:outline}
This thesis describes the research work that resulted in the development and validation of several crucial pre-preprocessing steps and ultimately a \ac{mpmri}-\ac{cad} system for detection of \ac{cap}.
Different \ac{mri} imaging techniques and modalities are presented in \textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:2}.
Latter towards the main objective of this thesis, extensitve study of the state-of-the-art \ac{cad} systems proposed for \ac{cap} is presented in \textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:3}.
In \textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:4} we present the materials used and produced by this theis. 
\textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:5} contains our fist contribution regariding a crucial step of nomarlization in pre-processing of \ac{t2w} and \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} modalities.
The \ac{cad} system developed, our experiments and results obtained are depicted in \textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:6}.
Finally \textbf{Chapter}\,\ref{chap:7} concludes the thesis and presents avenues for future research.
