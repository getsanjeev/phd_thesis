\section{Image regularization framework}\label{sec:chp3:img-reg}

This section provides a review of the methods used in \acp{cad} for \ac{cap} in order to regularize input images.
We start with pre-processing methods presented in \acs{sec}.~\ref{subsec:chp3img-reg:prepro}, focusing mainly on the reduction of noise level and artefacts as well as standardization of \ac{si}.
Sections \ref{subsec:chp3:img-reg:seg} and \ref{subsec:chp3:img-reg:regi} will be dedicated to segmentation methods, so that later methods only operate on the segmented prostate, and registration to align segmented images from different \ac{mri}-modalities in the same reference frame.

%We start with pre-processing methods, focusing mainly on the reduction of noise level and artefacts as well as standardization of \ac{si}, following by a segmentation and registration sections.
