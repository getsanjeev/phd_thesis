\chapter{Normalization/Standardization of T2W-MRI and DCE-MRI Images} \label{chap:5}

As a pre-processing steps, image normalization is an important step of the chain.
Normalization is a highly crucial step to overcome the inter-patient intensity variations occurring, enforce the repeatability, and achieve a robust classification~\cite{Lemaitre2015}.
However, little attention has been dedicated to the problem of normalization of \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} prostate images~\cite{Lemaitre2015}.
