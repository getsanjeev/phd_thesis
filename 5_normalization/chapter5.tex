\chapter{Normalization/Standardization of T2W-MRI and DCE-MRI Images} \label{chap:5}
\Ac{cad} systems are usually designed as a sequential process consisting of four stages: pre-processing, segmentation, registration and classification.
As a pre-processing image and data normalization is a crutial and important step of the chain in order to design a robust classifier and overcome the inter-patients intensity variations.
However little attention has been dedicated to the normalization.
In this section, we first propose two methods for normalization of \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} prostate images based on: (i) Rician \emph{a priori} and (ii) \ac{srsf} representation.
Then we proposed a fully atumated framework for normalization of \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} images.
In both cases, a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods are provided.
