\chapter{Proposed CADe-CADx system for CAP}\label{chap:6}
In this chapter we describe our developed \ac{cade}-\ac{cadx} framework for detection of prostate cancer.
The developed frameworks follow the same outline as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:wkfcad}, 
In the regularization step, different modalities undergo pre-processing, segmentation and registration. 
While in the second phase varitey of features are detected, sampled and classified.
In comparison to traditional \ac{cad} systems, the problem of imbalanced data is also considered and prior to feature selection we balance our training set using different techniques.

Different aspects of the proposed \ac{cad} system including features detection, balancing, selction and finally classification are tested over variety of experiments.
The reminder of this chapter presents the developed methodology, the designed experiments and the results obtained.
